## Lessons I Learned

- Bootstrap is great for getting a quick website fast. However it'll never replace CSS fully.

- Bootstrap is a tool in the toolbox for web development. I don't think i'd ever make it the end all be all.

- To take my time and enjoy the process and to have fun because this was a really fun project that I plan on returning to and fleshing out more when I have time.


## Pitfalls

No matter how hard I tried I did use d-flex in a few lines to get the card's image in the carousel to not overlap with the controls.
- line 96
- line 113
- line 131
- line 150
- line 394

I spent way too much time on the navbar and the single item carousel that it took three day to get the layout right it still isn't where I want it to be but those are what I'm the most proud of.

I couldn't figure out how to make the multi-item carousel to work within the parameters of the project I did get them to stack.

Pretty sure I did not do what I was suppose to for dropdown it was one of the last component item I added.
